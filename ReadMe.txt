Both the space complexity and the time complexity of this program is both O(n) because in the function detectLoop, which is the function that returns the index of the start of a cycle, there is a HashMap which has the space complexity of O(n) because it adds every LinkedList item that there is and it has a running time of O(n) because the while loop will loop through every item in the LinkedList regardless of weather or not it is a cycled linked list. Side Node: The main function is detectLoop(Node<E> head), everything else was just for testing.
